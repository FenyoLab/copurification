<h3>
What is the importance of the Single Reagent Flag and method of elution?
</h3>
<p>
Our system is designed to correlate the in vitro solutions used to release and capture protein 
complexes with the analytical results obtained in the form of SDS-PAGE banding profiles and mass 
spectrometry results. Hence, we need to know if a result is obtained by using more than one distinctive 
solution. Our aim is to help you find the best solution to use to get the best results for your 
application – and to understand the parameters affecting the behavior of protein complexes in vitro. 
In many cases this can be done using a single step affinity capture with a single extraction and washing 
solution. Please refer to Hakhverdyan et al. 2015 [link to paper]. However, if your results were obtained 
using multiple solutions, you can still benefit from the tools available at copurification.org. In this 
case, please indicate ‘no’ in the appropriate field and add details in the Notes section. We also suggest 
you upload an <a target='_blank' href='http://www.psidev.info/node/91'>MIAPE compliant document</a>
of the experimental procedure.

<p>
Likewise, results obtained by SDS-PAGE or MS may be affected or biased by the method of elution from the 
affinity medium. Some elution solutions are not powerful enough to uniformly release the affinity 
immobilized protein complexes. We recommend a solution containing 2% w/v SDS or SDS-PAGE sample as the 
solution of choice for reproducible and uniform elution. However, in the case that other solutions are 
used to elute, please keep track of this in the Notes section of your sample description sheet.
