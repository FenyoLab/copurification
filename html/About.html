<h2>About copurification.org</h2>	<p align="justify">This site is intended for the curation of images displaying protein co-purification banding patterns resulting from affinity capture
	followed by e.g. SDS-PAGE and protein staining. The conditions of each affinity capture experiment curated here are linked to the resulting
	banding pattern so that purifications carried out in different conditions and/or by different researchers can be effectively searched and
	compared to one another. See our <a href="HowTo.html">HOWTO</a>
	and <a href="FAQ.html">FAQ</a>  for instructions and tips. This site should be particularly useful for labs running large
	numbers of exploratory affinity capture experiments to easily organize and refer back to results, and for others wishing to navigate such
	results to benefit from the cumulative exploration of many researchers. </p>
	<p align="justify">This site will contain two interfaces: one public and one private. In the private interface only the account holder can access the data
	s/he uploads and the account holder is free to edit or change or delete the data. Data lodged privately may be made publicly accessible at
	the account holder's desire, but this is especially encouraged upon publication. Public data may be accessed and searched by any user, but is
	locked and cannot be freely removed or otherwise changed. Importantly, this site is designed to integrate with and meet the criteria of the
	<a href="http://www.psidev.info/node/91" target="_blank">MIAPE</a>  and <a href="http://mibbi.sourceforge.net/about.shtml" target="_blank">MIBBI</a>  initiatives.</p>
	</p><p align="justify">This is public beta version 0.9 of this site and it will continually evolve to meet the needs of curating and data mining affinity capture co-purification
	experiments. Currently, only the private side of the site is available for general use. However, the data resulting from our recently developed
	affinity capture conditions screening process (Hakhverdyan et al, submitted) is available for searching and viewing through the public interface.
	See this <a href="" title="Please check back soon for a TODO list for the next version...">list</a>  for features currently in the development pipeline.</p>
	<br>
	<p align="justify"><i>As much as possible, we aim to implement Minimum Information Standards  and implement Ontologies and Controlled Vocabularies
	to maximize the value of experimental data lodged in this repository.</i></p>
	<p align="justify">This site was created by Sarah Keegan, Zhanna Hakhverdyan, John LaCava and David Fenyo &#45; and is supported and maintained by The <a href="http://www.ncdir.org" target="_blank">NCDIR</a>
